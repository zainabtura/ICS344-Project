# üìä ICS344 ‚Äì Phase 2: Visual Analysis with a SIEM Dashboard

In this phase, we focused on leveraging a SIEM platform‚Äî**Splunk**‚Äîto collect, analyze, and visualize logs from both the attacker and victim environments. The goal was to monitor the attack activity from multiple perspectives and gain a deeper understanding of how the attack unfolded.

To fulfill the project requirements, we completed the following:

- **Integrated logs** from both the victim (Metasploitable3) and attacker (Kali Linux) environments into Splunk.
- **Visualized the attack behavior** using Splunk dashboards and searches to identify authentication patterns, brute-force attempts, and indicators of compromise.
- **Compared logs** from both environments to correlate actions performed by the attacker with reactions and logs recorded on the victim system.

This setup allowed us to clearly observe the full lifecycle of the attack and demonstrate how a SIEM can be used for forensic analysis, monitoring, and alerting.

Below, we walk through each step in setting up Splunk and performing the required tasks, supported with screenshots and log evidence.

###  Step 1: Downloading and Extracting Splunk

To begin the SIEM setup, we downloaded the official Splunk installer for Linux from Splunk‚Äôs website. We used the `.tgz` archive format suitable for manual extraction.

The following actions were performed:

1. **Downloaded the Splunk package** using `wget`, which fetched version `9.4.1` of the 64-bit Linux release.
2. **Moved the downloaded archive** to the `/opt` directory, which is commonly used for installing optional or third-party software.
3. **Extracted the archive** in `/opt` using the `tar` command, which created a directory containing all necessary Splunk files and folders.

These steps ensured Splunk was properly unpacked and ready for configuration within the attacker machine (Kali Linux), as required for SIEM dashboard setup.

```bash
wget https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.4.1/linux/splunk-9.4.1-83dbab203ac8-linux-amd64.tgz
sudo mv splunk-9.4.1-83dbab203ac8-linux-amd64.tgz /opt/
cd /opt/
sudo tar xvzf splunk-9.4.1-83dbab203ac8-linux-amd64.tgz
```

###  Step 2: First Launch of Splunk

After extracting Splunk, we proceeded to start the service and complete the initial setup required for first-time use.

We navigated to the Splunk binary directory and started the service using the following command:

```bash
cd /opt/splunk/bin
sudo ./splunk start --accept-license
```

![Step 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35471fbe-205b-49f5-b020-8a6eab2c1b53)

The --accept-license flag was used to automatically approve the Splunk license agreement. During the first-time startup, Splunk prompted us to create an administrator account. We set a username and a secure password as part of the setup process.

The initialization process included several checks and operations:

Validation of installation files
Setup of directories for logs, sessions, hash storage, and configurations
Generation of RSA private keys for internal communication
Configuration of certificate files (privKeySecure.pem)
Startup of the Splunk server daemon (splunkd)
After all checks passed, Splunk began listening on its default service ports:

- 8000 ‚Üí Web Interface
- 8089 ‚Üí Management Port
- 8065 ‚Üí App Server Port
- 8191 ‚Üí KV Store
Once the setup completed, the web interface became available at:
```bash
http://kali:8000
```
This URL provides access to the Splunk dashboard, where we can begin configuring data inputs, monitoring logs, and building visualizations.

---

### Step 3: Configuring Splunk to Receive Logs

We then opened the browser from the Kali attacker VM and go to `http://kali:8000`.  
Then we login using the admin credentials that were created during the initial setup.


After that, we navigated to:

```
Search ‚Üí Data ‚Üí Forwarding and Receiving
```
![Add Data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/175a382a-c763-44de-8144-4e52e0d35e64)


We then navigated to add new in the ‚ÄúReceive data‚Äù section and began the setup to allow Splunk to accept forwarded log data. And from there, we created a new TCP input on port `9997` to accept logs from external sources.

### Step 4: Installing Splunk Forwarder on the Victim Machine

To forward logs from the victim environment (Metasploitable3), we installed the Splunk Universal Forwarder.  
This lightweight version of Splunk is designed specifically for collecting and sending logs to a remote Splunk server.

```bash
wget -O splunkforwarder-9.4.1...deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/..."
```

![Download Command](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9327fa54-ee0f-4e61-9901-346a1b419096)

After running the installer, it showed the license agreement that we needed to accept to proceed.

![License Prompt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c247fb2-18af-461d-9a78-be822477dbfc)

Once the download completed successfully, the `.deb` package was saved and ready for installation.

---

### Step 5: Connect Forwarder to Splunk Server

After installation, we configured the forwarder to send logs to our Splunk instance:

```bash
sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add forward-server 172.20.10.7:9997
```

We were then prompted to enter the Splunk username and password.

---

### Step 6: Configure Log Monitoring

Next, we configured the forwarder to monitor the file `/var/log/auth.log`, which contains authentication and login attempts.

```bash
sudo /opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add monitor /var/log/auth.log
```

---

### Step 7: Executing Custom SSH Brute Force Script

Before analyzing the logs in Splunk, we executed a custom Python script (`ssh_bruteforce.py`) on the attacker machine to simulate an SSH brute-force attack against the victim (Metasploitable3).

The script uses the `paramiko` library to try multiple username and password combinations. It successfully established a connection using the credentials:

- **Username:** `vagrant`
- **Password:** `vagrant`

Once valid credentials were found, the script executed a command (`uname -a`) on the victim machine to confirm shell access and saved the credentials inside a file named `credentials.txt`.

This confirmed that the brute-force attempt worked and gave us remote access to the target over SSH.

### üìä Step 8: Visualizing the Attack Logs in Splunk

After setting up the forwarder and generating SSH brute-force activity, we used the Splunk Search interface to visualize the data.

Query used:

```spl
index=* source="/var/log/auth.log" "sshd" | timechart count by user
```
